Implement parallel algorithms to sort large arrays.
Implement mergesort, quicksort, radix sort, brick sort, and bitonic sort. Compare their performance.

What are some metrics that we should use to compare algorithms for each sort?

- time complexity
- work complexity
- space complexity
- execution time
- scalability of exectution time
- difference between times for sequential algorithms and their respective parallel algorithms
- consider the stability of each algorithm

type of data to use

- nearly sorted data
- completely random sorted data
- sorted data
- reverse sorted data
- large data sets
- small data sets
