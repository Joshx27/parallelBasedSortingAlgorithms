Implement parallel algorithms to sort large arrays.
Implement mergesort, quicksort, radix sort, brick sort, and bitonic sort. Compare their performance.

What are some metrics that we should use to compare algorithms for each sort?

- time complexity
- work complexity
- space complexity
- execution time
- execution time / scalability graph
